# AI-Assisted Coding Helper

## Overview
Design and build a Chrome extension that helps developers learn from coding problems on educational platforms like LeetCode. The extension should streamline the process of getting AI-generated assistance without requiring users to manually copy and paste problem details.

## Core Requirements
1. Automatically detect when a user is viewing a coding problem on LeetCode
2. Create a solution that efficiently obtains AI assistance for solving the detected problem
3. Present the AI-generated content in a user-friendly interface within the browser

## Technical Considerations
- The extension should be lightweight and performant
- Implement secure handling of any API keys or user credentials
- Create an intuitive user interface that enhances the learning experience
- Consider browser capabilities that could simplify the implementation

## AI Tool Usage Guidelines

Candidates are encouraged to use AI coding assistants (such as GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or other LLM-based tools) to help develop their solution. If you choose to leverage AI tools:

- Document the specific prompts you used when generating code with AI tools
- Explain your process for refining and iterating on AI-generated content
- Highlight which parts of your solution were developed with AI assistance versus written manually
- Share any interesting insights about your experience using AI tools for this project
- Include examples of when AI tools were particularly helpful or where they fell short

We're interested not just in your final solution, but in how you effectively collaborate with AI tools as part of your development workflow. There is no penalty for using AI assistantsâ€”on the contrary, thoughtful and efficient use of these tools demonstrates valuable skills in today's development environment.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and structure
- Creative problem-solving approach
- Effective use of AI tools in the solution
- User experience considerations
- Security and performance optimizations
- Documentation quality

## Deliverables
- Full source code for the Chrome extension
- Brief documentation explaining your approach, architecture decisions, and any assumptions made
- Instructions for installation and testing
- Short explanation of how you would extend this solution in the future

This challenge tests your ability to translate a product concept into a working solution while making thoughtful technical decisions and effectively leveraging AI technologies.
